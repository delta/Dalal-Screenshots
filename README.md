## Welcome to Dalal Street's official Help Page!
## Please read our Getting Started section before playing the game.

### Getting Started

##### The Objective
Each player begins the game with ₹20,000. Your objective is to use this money to maximise your profit at the end of 7 days.

##### How do I make money?
These are the two ways to make money :-
*   Buying stocks at low prices and selling them at higher prices.
*   Short selling stocks and then buying them back for a lower price.

Please note that you can only place orders when the market is open (8PM-12AM IST).

_If you’re unsure of what short selling means, check out our FAQ section._

##### The Basics

There are a total of 5 companies trading publicly on the Dalal Street Exchange. To know more about each company, check out the **Companies Page**, which is shown in the image below. On this page, you’ll find a short description about each company as well as its latest stock price information.

Please note that the companies on the Dalal Street Exchange are **in no way related to their real world counterparts**. The stock prices and news articles released in this game are entirely fictitious and will NOT be affected by real world events.

Before the game begins, all stocks will be held by the exchange. As soon as the market opens on Day 1, the stocks will be open for all of the players to buy. Buying stocks from the exchange can be done from the **Exchange Page**, as shown below.

We also recommend that you pay close attention to the **News Page**. This page will constantly be updated with articles about company news, scandals, rumours, or even political developments. Staying connected with story developments could give you an edge over other players as this is the best way to predict the future performance of a company.

_Pro Tip_: If you’re using the Dalal Street Android App, you will receive a notification on your phone every time a new story is published.

##### Buying and Selling Stocks

All trading related tasks are performed on the **Trading Page**, which is shown in the image below.

Lets walk through all the elements of this page.

**Order Book** \- The Market Depth lists all _open_ buy and sell orders. This includes orders issued by _all players_. By observing the Market Depth, you can see the prices at which other players are placing their orders and judge the current mood of the market. The Trading History displays the last 15 transactions that have been executed for the company you’ve chosen.

**Place Orders** \- There are 3 different types of orders you can place - Market, Limit and Stoploss. _(You can read more about these terms in our FAQ section)_. Once your orders are placed, we will match the order based on a _best match_ algorithm.

**Open Orders** \- These are the orders that you have placed but have not been filled yet. After you place an order, the order will appear here until it is successfully filled.

**Price Chart** \- This shows how the stock price of the selected company has changed over time. You can view the chart with different time intervals by using the dropdown above the chart. This allows you to analyse the data at different levels of detail.

Once you’ve bought some stocks, you can view all the stocks you own as well as your _Net Worth_ on the **Portfolios Page**, as shown in the image below. This page also displays a list of all your **executed transactions**.

Hopefully, this should be enough to get you going and start trading! If you still have some questions, please read our FAQ section where we address some more common doubts that players may have.

### FAQ
##### Help! I don’t know what Market, Limit and Stoploss orders are!

These are the 3 types of orders that you can place. The type of order you select can change the trade price as well as how soon your order gets filled.

1.  **Market Orders**: If your primary concern is to have your order filled ASAP, and you’re not too worried about the price at which the transaction is carried out, you should use a Market Order. However, make sure that _you keep an eye on the Market Depth_ before issuing one of these transactions to ensure that you don’t get ripped off!

_How it Works_: A Market Buy Order will find the best matching Sell Order for the same company, and execute the transaction. Similarly, a Market _Sell_ Order will find the best matching Buy Order for the same company, and execute the transaction.

2.  **Limit Orders**: Limit Orders allow you to specify a _maximum_ trade price in case of a Limit Buy, and a _minimum_ trade price in case of a Limit Sell.

_How it Works_: A Limit _Buy_ Order will find the best matching Sell Order whose trade price is _below_ the limit that you have specified, and execute the transaction. Similary, A Limit _Sell_ Order will find the best matching Buy Order whose trade price is _above_ the limit that you have specified, and execute the transaction.

3.  **Stoploss Orders**: Stopless Buy Orders are used to jump on a rising trend and Stoploss Sell Orders are used to lock in a profit/limit your losses.

_How it Works_: Stoploss orders are converted to Market Orders once the price crosses the Stoploss price that you set. In case of a Stoploss _Buy_, your order will be converted to a _Market Buy_ as soon as the stock’s price rises _above_ the Stoploss price that you set. Similarly, in case of a Stoploss _Sell_, your order will be converted to a _Market Sell_ as soon as the stock’s price falls _below_ the Stoploss price that you set.

##### What exactly is this _trade price_ and how is it determined?

The trade price is the price at which a transaction is executed. Our algorithm uses a **best match approach** to match Buy Orders to Sell orders as well as to determine the price at which the trade is executed. You can view the trade price of all of your executed transactions on the **Portfolio Page**.

##### What is this short selling you speak of?

While you will _buy_ a company’s stock if you expect its price to go up, **you can _short sell_ a company’s stock if you expect its price to go down**. In a nutshell, short selling means to sell stocks that you don’t own so that you can buy them back at a lower price.

For example, short selling 5 shares of a company XYZ is mathematically equivalent to buying -5 shares of XYZ. When you short sell, your _Cash In Hand_ will increase and your _Stock Worth_ will accordingly decrease such that your **_Net Worth_ remains the same** _(Remember: Net Worth = Cash In Hand + Stock Worth)_.

After you short sell a company, if the stock price dips below the price you sold it for, then you will have made a profit and vice-versa.

_Note: You can only short sell a maximum of 50 stocks per company_

##### What is my Net Worth and how is it calculated?

The player with the highest Net Worth at the end of 7 days is the winner. Your Net Worth is split into two parts - _Cash In Hand_ and _Stock Worth_. You can view these values on the **Portfolio page**. Here’s a table explaining how your Net Worth will change in response to different events :-
| Event | Cash In Hand | Stock Worth | Net Worth
| ------ | ------ |-|-|
| Buy stocks | Decreases | Increases | Constant
| Sell stocks | Increases | Decreases | Constant
| Stock price rises | Constant | Increases | Increases
| Stock price falls | Constant | Decreases | Decreases

##### What is the difference between _Stocks in Exchange_ and _Stocks in Market_?

In the **Companies Page**, you’ll find an entry for Stocks in Exchange as well as an entry for Stocks in Market. Let’s clarify the difference between the two :-

*   **Stocks in Exchange** \- The number of stocks that the Dalal Street Exchange currently holds. This number will be the same as the number found under the _Available_ column in the **Exchange Page**.
*   **Stocks in Market** \- The number of stocks that are currently held by all of the players in the game.

When the game begins, the _Stocks in Market_ will be **zero** since all stocks are initially held by the exchange. As soon as the market opens on Day 1 and players begin buying from the exchange, the number of _Stocks in Market_ will increase and the number of _Stocks in Exchange_ will decrease.

If the number of Stocks in Exchange is zero, it means that all shares of this company are currently in the hands of the players. Therefore, you can no longer buy shares from the exchange and instead, you'll have to place Buy Orders on the **Trading Page** to buy any stock.

##### Can I expect any new companies to pop up over the course of the game?

While we don’t expect any more companies to go public over the course of this game, existing companies may release more shares in the middle. If this happens, then the number of _Stocks in Exchange_ will increase, and you can buy these stocks from the **Exchange Page**. Stay tuned to the **News Page** or download the Dalal Street Android App to be the first to know when to expect more shares.
